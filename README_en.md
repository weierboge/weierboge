I've created several free small tools with the help of GitHub and AI tools:

1. [Hongshubang - One-click to Add Emoji Expressions on Xiaohongshu](https://www.hongshubang.com): It can convert your copywriting into the Xiaohongshu format with emoji expressions in one click.

2. [Online Word Count Tool](https://zishutongji.com/): A simple word count tool.

3. [One-click Markdown Format Conversion Tool](https://weierboge.github.io/markdowntool/) This is a tool for converting text between Markdown format and ordinary format. It can directly convert the Markdown format text generated by AI tools like Doubao, DeepSeek, etc. into text that can be directly pasted into Word or WeChat. The formatted text retains the structure and style of the document and removes some unordered list symbols, making it easier to read and edit.

4. [Xiaohongshu Card Generator: Generate Xiaohongshu Graphic Cards with One Click](https://weierboge.github.io/Redbookcard/)

Access address: [Xiaohongshu Card Generator](https://weierboge.github.io/Redbookcard/)

This tool supports converting both ordinary text and Markdown text into Xiaohongshu cards with one click. 
You can adjust the content distribution of the card by using blank lines and font sizes.

I don't know anything about programming at all and have a 0-code foundation. These tools were developed with the assistance of the DeepSeek R1 chat tool, Trae, and Claude-3.5. I'd like to express my gratitude to DeepSeek and ByteDance for allowing me to use these tools for free.
